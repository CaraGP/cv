          <p>
            Hi! I'm Dean. I'm a passionate, customer-focused and quality-first
            front-end software engineer with a broad range of skills. I have
            more than ten years experience in delivering business and customer
            needs in an Agile way, as well as nurturing teams to become the best
            delivery-focused units they can. I pride myself on enabling and
            guiding evolution at the team level, consistently striving for a
            high standard of work, being good-natured, outgoing and having a
            good sense of humour.

          <Subtitle>Me</Subtitle>
          <p>Front-end software has always been my core passion.</p>
          <p>
            I'm a data-driven thinker and I use my strong Agile analytical and
            organisational skills to drive technically excellent and sustainable
            solutions that my team and I build.
          </p>
          <ReadMore>
            <p>
              I attend various Agile meetups in order to keep myself up to date
              with how other teams tackle real-world Lean delivery issues.
              Although I do reference a variety of reading material, meetups are
              my go-to source for on-the-ground techniques and advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am able to work on my own, but I have almost always found that
              teamwork trumps all silo-based work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am lively, outgoing and approachable. I love playing video games
              (especially RPGs), developing software on pet projects (currently
              learning Lua!) and cooking in my new dream kitchen, having wanted
              to be a chef when I was younger (before I got my hands on a PC!).
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a fan of electronic house music and enjoy attending music
              festivals.
            </p>
            <p>
              My person-to-person and written skills are excellent and I always
              try to bring enthusiasm and adaptability to my work.

                When the business changed direction away from their legacy
                products, I moved to a different team where I was required to
                plan the implementation of a completely new front-end stack,
                which included moving away from an old Backbone application with
                manual builds and no test coverage, to a React/Redux application
                (ES6) fully covered by Jest unit tests and automated
                Behaviour-driven scenarios, powered by Webpack, Yarn etc.
