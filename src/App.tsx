            <p>
              Hi! I'm Dean. I'm a passionate, customer-focused and quality-first
              front-end software engineer with a broad range of skills. I have
              more than ten years experience in delivering business and customer
              needs in an Agile way, as well as nurturing teams to become the
              best delivery-focused units they can. I pride myself on enabling
              and guiding evolution at the team level, consistently striving for
              a high standard of work, being good-natured, outgoing and having a
              good sense of humour.
            </p>

            <p>Front-end software has always been my core passion.</p>
            <p>
              I'm a data-driven thinker and I use my strong Agile analytical and
              organisational skills to drive technically excellent and
              sustainable solutions that my team and I build.
            </p>

              <p>
                I attend various Agile meetups in order to keep myself up to
                date with how other teams tackle real-world Lean delivery
                issues. Although I do reference a variety of reading material,
                meetups are my go-to source for on-the-ground techniques and
                advice.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am able to work on my own, but I have almost always found that
                teamwork trumps all silo-based work.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am lively, outgoing and approachable. I love playing video
                games (especially RPGs), developing software on pet projects
                (currently learning Lua!) and cooking in my new dream kitchen,
                having wanted to be a chef when I was younger (before I got my
                hands on a PC!).
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a fan of electronic house music and enjoy attending music
                festivals.
              </p>
              <p>
                My person-to-person and written skills are excellent and I
                always try to bring enthusiasm and adaptability to my work.

                  When the business changed direction away from their legacy
                  products, I moved to a different team where I was required to
                  plan the implementation of a completely new front-end stack,
                  which included moving away from an old Backbone application
                  with manual builds and no test coverage, to a React/Redux
                  application (ES6) fully covered by Jest unit tests and
                  automated Behaviour-driven scenarios, powered by Webpack, Yarn
                  etc.
